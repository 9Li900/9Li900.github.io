    <p>Almost there. I’ll meet you inside.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skye rolled her eyes at Julia’s message. This was exactly why she didn’t like making plans with her younger sister. Julia had fun ideas, but participating in them didn’t matter as she was chronically late to every single event.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skye switched off her phone and looked up at the top of the building in front of her. The tan building had a wooden sign that read, “The Museum of Love.” She wasn’t completely sure why Julia had picked this place, but something about the place’s name intrigued her. Most museums had sections dedicated to the magical artifacts of the past depicting love and romance, but was it really so interesting for there to be a whole museum itself about the topic?</p>    
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her thoughts didn’t come up with an answer to the question, so she opened the tall glass doors in front of her.</p> 
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was immediately greeted by a receptionist at the front desk. The woman seemed to have a whimsical aura around her, and the corners of her eyes crinkled as she smiled at Skye.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“How many tickets?” The woman, who had a name tag reading “Amara,” asked.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Skye wondered if she should buy Julia’s ticket now for a brief moment. “Just one, please.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“That will be sixteen dollars and sixteen cents.”</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She paid with her credit card and grabbed the paper ticket from Amara’s hand, wandering away from the reception desk to look around the room layout and see where she should go first.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The museum was smaller than she expected, with only three large painting sections, a marked “special display,” and a few sculptures and statues scattered around the room, plus a gift shop. The overall aesthetic was put together, however, with pale pink wallpaper and yellowed tiles on the walls and floor. There was also a big chandelier in the very center of the museum, near the special display, with much smaller, less harsh lights brightening the rest of the art taking up the space. She decided to start all the way to the left, and make her way around in an arch shape. Hopefully, Julia would be here before she finished checking everything out.</p>
